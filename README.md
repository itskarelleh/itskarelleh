<h1>Hi there!</h1>
I am a customer-focused, dedicated web developer who puts 100% effort into the process from start to finish rather it's a simple landing page or a dynamic web app. Though I primarily use JavaScript frameworks like React.js for the majority of my development projects, I am very confident when learning new languages and frameworks that may be a better fit for the project.

<h2>More About Me: </h2>
- ⚡ Fun fact: Before learning to code, I used to be a designer and still use some of my design skills if needed.
👩🏿‍💻 Currently use: React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase, Next.js, Tailwind.css, Material-UI/MUI
