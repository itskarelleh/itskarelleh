<h1>Hello! Â¡Hola! Bonjour!</h1>
I am a dedicated, full stack developer based in New Jersey with a Bootcamp/self-taught background. I typically like to do my front-end projects using JavaScript frameworks like Next.js and backend-projects using Java frameworks like Spring Boot but I'm always open to learning new languages and frameworks.
