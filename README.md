### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently searching for my first job as a Full Stack Developer. In the meantime, I keep myself busy and active with a few self-initiated projects such as my own portfolio website. I'm also open to collaborating with other developers. If you want to network or want me to collaborate with you, please send me a messsage on LinkedIn or send me an email. Thank you!
